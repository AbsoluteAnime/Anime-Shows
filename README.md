http://www.animefevers.net/ Animation is a priceless tool for all types of media when the impossible is required to become possible. For example, there are no limits to action or comedy in an animated feature, and animation provides these additional effects in a live action feature, effects that would not be possible to recreate safely or due to the limitations of a human actor.The production of an animated feature or series is carried out in an almost identical process to that of a live action feature or series.
